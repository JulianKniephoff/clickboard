* DevOps
** Write a ~README~
** Pick a license
*** Does your choice of GUI toolkit play into this?
**** Look up what license different toolkits would impose on you
Cadidates:
- PySide
- PyQt
** Add a shebang?
** Add a ~requirements.txt~?
** Split the code into multiple files?
*** You will probably need some kind of start script then
See also [[*Add a shebang?][Add a shebang?]]
** Take care of distribution
*** Make a ~pip~ package?
*** Make operating system packages?
** Use PySide instead of PyQt?
* Features
** Should we grab the mouse?
** What should happen if the mouse is moved during the search?
*** Should we reposition it?
*** Should the current position determine the split?
**** We could even start the search that way
** When the window moves (for example between monitors), the mouse needs to be repositioned
** More flexible key bindings
*** Allow multiple bindings?
Like ~vim~-like bindings plus WASD
to have bindings under both hands
when touch typing.
*** Make them configurable
** Allow reversing steps of the search
** Enable clicking different mouse buttons, buttons with modifiers, etc.
*** Can we support hovering?
What if we don't grab the focus,
would that help?
Is that even possible?
** Better support for multiple monitors
** Only allow one instance of this program to run
** Support limiting the search to another window?
